Today  marks  my  arrival  in  the  capital  city  of  Veridia,  a  place  teeming  with  vibrant  cultural
heritage and an unyielding commitment to progress. Under Queen Isolde's famed patronage, the
arts  flourished  here.  Walking  through  the  grand  avenues,  I  was  captivated  by  the  array  of
sculptures and paintings, bearing testament to her legacy. My first stop was the regal Assembly
House,  where  the  Assembly  of  Voices,  Veridia's  main  legislative  body,  convenes.  The  debate
inside,  I  was  told,  revolved  around  initiatives  to  fulfill  Veridia’s  ambitious  goal  of  using  80%
renewable  energy  by  2050.  This  pervasive  focus  on  sustainability  is  palpable,  infusing  the  city’s
very lifeblood.
